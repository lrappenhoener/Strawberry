# Introduction 
The **Strawberry Dependency Injection Container (DI Container)** is a lightweight, yet powerful, Java dependency injection
 framework designed for personal use and learning purposes. It aims to provide a simple yet effective way to manage
 dependencies in Java applications, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain software.
Strawberry is not intended for production environments, as it may lack the robustness and features of more established
 frameworks like Spring or Guice. However, it serves as an excellent tool for understanding the core concepts of dependency
 injection, such as inversion of control, dependency resolution, and lifecycle management.
Key Features:
- **Simple API**: Easy to use, with minimal boilerplate code required to define and inject dependencies.
- **Manual Configuration**: Allows for fine-grained control over the dependency injection process, suitable for small projects
 or learning scenarios.
- **No External Dependencies**: Built from scratch, ensuring no external libraries are required, making it lightweight and
 easy to integrate into any Java project.
